# LoRa Beacon
Esp32 / Arduino beacon using GPS + LoRa
The beacons use a TTGO T-Beam microcontroller to: 
1) Fix its position on Earth 
2) Distribute that position via a LoRa radio network
3) Display recieved positions in human-meaningful form on a low power display device 

Concieved as art project / person finder for Burning Man, with an eye towards other rugged off-grid location tracking uses such as backpacking. Inspired by the Future Robot's Burning Man Tailsman art project.
